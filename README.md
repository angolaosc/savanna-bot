A discord bot to find Github's good first issue on different repositories.

## Get it

You can add the bot to your server by clicking on [<img alt="discord" width="100px" src="assets/discord.png"/>](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1138189651593674845&permissions=274877908992&scope=bot)

## How to use

- `/svn <param>: <your query>` - Search for good first issues on GitHub
> Example: `/svn language:python`

The query parameters are the same as the ones used on GitHub's search bar. See the full list [here](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).

Some of the most used parameters are:

- `owner` - Filter by the user that created the issue.
- `language` - Filter by the language the repository is written in.
- `label` - Filter by the labels applied to the issue.
- `state` - Filter by the state of the issue.
- `repo` - Filter by the repository the issue belongs to.

You can also use any combination of the parameters above.
> Example: `/svn owner:angolaosc language:python repo:angolaosc/savanna-bot`
